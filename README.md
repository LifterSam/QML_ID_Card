Hello,

this is a quick presentation of QML with a very simple ID card. If you run the code in a suitable 
environment you can click on the button in the left bottom corner and it will swap out general 
informations against detailed informations and vice versa. The URL can be clicked if the code is run
and should open the system standard browser and show this repository.

You can see the card generated in the two pictures: ID_LifterSam_General.PNG and ID_LifterSam_Detail.PNG

The code consists of a C++ main.cpp file including the neccessary statements to bind in a QML application.
Forthermore the Main.qml file contains all the QML code for the here shown visualization. The code has
detailed comments implemented since it is for learners to show concepts.

Best regards,
Thomas
